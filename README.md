# service-mesh-benchmark-spec
A common format for describing and capturing performance benchmark test environmental configuration, mesh configuration and types of tests.

This specification is currently being advanced through discussion in the [Meshery](https://layer5.io/meshery) project.

## Meshery

A service mesh playground to faciliate learning about functionality and performance of different service meshes. Meshery incorporates the collection and display of metrics from applications running in the playground.

- Join the weekly [community meeting](https://layer5.io/assets/projects/meshery/Meshery-Community-Meeting.ics) to participate or visit the [project site](https://layer5.io/meshery) for more information.
